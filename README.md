# RPN-Calculator
This project is a simple calculator CLI app, which uses Reverse Polish Notation to make it easier for computers to compile.
This was a fun little challenge to take on as it was first time creating a CLI, so I had to learn how to get user input through the console (I chose Inquirer as there were some pretty informative videos on YouTube about them) but it also wasn't quite my first rodeo with Javascript or even NodeJs, so it was fairly easy to get the swing of things.
